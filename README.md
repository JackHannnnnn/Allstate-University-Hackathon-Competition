# First Place Solution to the Allstate University Hackathon
The competition is about building a machine learning model to predict what event will come next given an ordinal sequence of customersâ€™ life events. The dimension of the original training dataset is (1122007, 3) and the test data set size is 100870.

The most important reason why I won this competition is my creative feature engineering. The original dataset has only three columns and the number of available features is very small. I figured out the underlying meaning of event codes and created many new features based on the classification of event codes. 

You can download the dataset from https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/allstate-event-prediction-challenge/data. Just run the file run.sh after downloading the data set.
